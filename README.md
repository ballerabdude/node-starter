# Node JS initial starting point

Here is my starting point for any node js app I create. I hope this helps you.

The starting point will allow you to write your tests and code in es6. No need to build es5 code to run in node.

clone and start your project here


Add you tests in the test dir and name you file in the following format *.test.js. 
Nested dir are ok since the index.js in the test dir will walk the whole test dir.  


I hope this helps

### Steps to take
1. ```git clone git@github.com:ballerabdude/node-starter.git```
2. ```cd node-starter```
3. ```rm -rf .git```
4. ```git init```
5. Rename project name in package.json to what you like
6. Rename project dir to what you like
6. PROFIT!!
